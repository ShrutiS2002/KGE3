                </header>
                <p>A Proctored test is controlled by an individual who supervises the candidates while they are taking the test. The primary role of a proctor is to guarantee the reliability and security of the test in a secure environment. In an educational institution or a business organization, proctored tests prove to be extremely effective and beneficial. Employers make a wide use of proctor tests in order to test the abilities and performance of a prospective employee and this process greatly helps them in their selection process. When a student takes a test under the observation of a proctor, it leads to an evocative authenticity to a student’s revealed mastery and competency of the subject. If a students performance in a particular test is assessed by individuals ware not acquainted with distance learning, proof of proctored tests can help in eliminating any questions in concern with the sincerity of the students work.</p>

                                he is completely involved in taking the test unlike distance learning through just
                                online courses where you cannot see the student and are unsure of his personality

                        <p>
                            Here are a few online proctoring tips that would be helpful for you:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If this is your first test with Brainmesures, please visit <a href="index.html"
                                target="_blank">www.brainmeasures.com</a> to test your equipment before logging
                                in. Make sure you close all other windows and software webcam before you visit the
                                page. </li>
                            <li>Your room should be well lit and quiet and a private room in order to avoid any
                                disturbance. Overhead lighting is preferred and you should have daylight quality
                                of light in your room. Please make sure your light source is not exactly behind
                                you since that might obstruct your proctor from seeing you clearly.</li>
                            <li>You should have your photo ID ready.</li>
                            <li>Try to bring a reflective surface such as a mirror, CD or DVD so that you can show
                                the edges of your monitor to your proctor.</li>
                            <li>Be sure about your webcam, microphone and speakers. Check them once if they are
                                installed and working properly.</li>
                            <li>Be sure about your computer that it is in working order.</li>
